- [x] Binary to Base64
- [x] Base64 to Binary
- [x] JSON to Base64
- [x] Base64 to JSON
- [x] Data URL encode/decode

### 2. Binary Operations
- [x] JSON to Binary
- [x] Binary to JSON
- [x] Text to Binary
- [x] Binary to Text

### 3. Format Conversions
- [x] JSON to XML
- [x] XML to JSON
- [x] JSON to YAML
- [x] YAML to JSON
- [x] JSON to CSV
- [x] CSV to JSON
- [x] JSON to Markdown
- [x] CSV to Markdown

### 4. HTML Generation

## Development Progress

### Phase 1: Project Setup âœ“
- [x] Created directory structure
- [x] Initialize package.json
- [x] Configure TypeScript
- [x] Set up build process

### Phase 2: Core Implementation (In Progress)
- [x] Base64 operations module
- [x] Binary operations module
- [x] Format conversion module
- [x] HTML generation module
- [x] Encoding operations module
- [x] Main node integration

### Phase 3: Documentation & Testing
- [x] README.md with examples
- [x] ARCHITECTURE.md
- [x] DEPLOYMENT.md
- [x] CLAUDE.md
- [x] CHANGELOG.md
- [ ] Testing with n8n
- [ ] Bug fixes

### Phase 4: Publishing
- [ ] Git repository initialization
- [ ] GitHub repository creation
- [ ] npm publication

## Technical Decisions

### Node Structure
- Resource-based operations (Base64, Binary, Format, HTML, Encoding)
- Each resource has specific operations
- Clean separation of concerns
- Modular utility functions

### Dependencies
- Minimal external dependencies for reliability
- js-yaml for YAML parsing
- xml2js for XML parsing
- csv-parse and csv-stringify for CSV operations
- marked for Markdown to HTML

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive validation
- Clear error messages
- Support for continueOnFail
- Proper type checking

## Current Issues & Notes

### Implementation Notes
- Keep operations simple and focused
- Each operation should do one thing well
- Provide clear examples in descriptions
- Ensure AI agent compatibility with usableAsTool

### Testing Checklist
- [ ] Test all Base64 operations
- [ ] Test binary data handling
- [ ] Test format conversions with edge cases
- [ ] Test HTML generation with various inputs
- [ ] Test encoding operations
- [ ] Test error handling
- [ ] Test with n8n workflow
